# Text-2-Talk and AI 3D Lip Sync Application

This application converts text into audio using Google's Cloud Text-to-Speech API and synchronizes a 3D model's lips to the generated speech. The application uses Three.js for 3D rendering, Blender for 3D model creation, and Node.js for backend functionality.

## Features

- Convert text to audio via Google Cloud's Text-to-Speech API.
- AI-driven 3D model lip synchronization based on generated audio.
- Real-time interaction with the model through a simple web interface.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (version >= 14.0.0).
- Google Cloud account with access to the Text-to-Speech API.
- A Blender-created 3D model for lip synchronization.
